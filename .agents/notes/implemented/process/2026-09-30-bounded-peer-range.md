# Agent Note: Bounded peer range

Status: implemented

## Problem

The [2026-09-29 exact-version disjunction](../archived/process/2026-09-29-exact-peer-disjunction.md)
pins the six `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` peers to an exact-version disjunction that
the DSH plugin manager enforces at install time. Every host RC the plugin
has not explicitly listed rejects installation for users on that version —
observed verbatim: `dsh: installation rejected: Plugin
dsh-subscription-hub@0.1.0 is incompatible with dsh 0.2.0-rc.1 ...` — even
when the plugin code is already verified compatible there (the full gate on
`0.2.0-rc.1` went green on 2026-09-29, and its host surface is byte-identical
to `rc.2`). The original decision never argued for "each new RC on the same
line immediately replaces its predecessor, with no parallel period"; that
behavior fell out of the window-definition sentence, not from a considered
trade-off. Meanwhile, two mature DSH plugins in the ecosystem —
`omdsh-dev/DSH-better-sidebar` (caret `^0.2.0-rc.1`) and
`ccch1mneyyy/dsh-TUI` (a 17-version cumulative disjunction with the real
compatibility contract in `contract.ts` plus a runtime drift warning) — both
follow the pattern "peers wider than the verified set, truth recorded
elsewhere, runtime/docs communicate the gap".

## Decision

The six `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` peerDependencies are declared as a **bounded
interval**: `>=<window floor> <(newest gated minor line + 1).0-0`, currently
`>=0.1.7-rc.2 <0.3.0-0`. The floor moves with the window floor; the ceiling
slides when a new minor line passes the gate (after `0.3.0-rc.1` gates, the
ceiling becomes `<0.4.0-0`). The ceiling must carry the `-0` suffix: under
`includePrerelease` semantics, `<0.3.0` admits `0.3.0-rc.1`, while
`<0.3.0-0` blocks the entire `0.3.0` line (verified against the `semver`
package directly).

The technical premise is verified, not assumed. The DSH 0.2.0-rc.2 plugin
manager evaluates `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` peers with
`semver.satisfies(runtimeVersion, range, { includePrerelease: true })` in
`evaluatePluginCompatibility` (dsh-app-boot), so an interval matches
prerelease runtimes. End-to-end, a packed tarball carrying the interval
peers passes `dsh plugin add` plus boot smoke on both `0.2.0-rc.1` and
`0.2.0-rc.2`. The pnpm-level missing-peer warning is inherent to the
host-injection model and appears with an exact disjunction just the same —
it is unrelated to range width.

What "supported" means is unchanged: the set of versions in
`dsh-versions.txt` that passed the full gate (build, tests, host-export and
host contract checks, boot smoke, host E2E), which CI still runs per window
version. The peer interval is deliberately wider than the verified set:
versions inside the interval but outside the window "may work, but
unsupported and at your own risk".

The window rule is revised alongside: the newest gated RC of each of the
three most recent minor lines, plus — in the newest minor line only — its
immediately preceding gated RC kept as a transition entry, capped at four
versions.

Users outside the interval (below the floor, or on a new minor line) take
the experimental exemption `dsh plugin allow-version <pkg@version>
--dsh-version <exact> --accept-risk` (a profile-level `compatibility.json`
with exact-version mappings).

The nightly next-host job becomes a pure tripwire: it pre-flights unverified
new versions inside the interval daily, and a red light triggers a fast PR
that tightens the interval (lower the ceiling or add an exclusion disjunct)
as the emergency brake.

## Alternatives considered

- **Strict exact disjunction + transition window.** Promises the hardest
  (peers exactly equal the verified set), but every host RC becomes an
  install rejection plus a maintenance event, and the rejected same-line
  versions are usually verified-compatible anyway (`0.2.0-rc.1` passed the
  full gate and exposes a byte-identical plugin surface to `rc.2`) —
  maximal strictness for little extra safety.
- **Unbounded floor (`>=0.1.7-rc.2`).** Makes "unverified future minor
  lines install by default" the default promise — and 0.x host breaking
  changes are routine; the existence of `compat.ts` (the
  `CallId`/`ToolCallId` rename) proves rename-class breaks really happened.
  The original note's "overbroad promise ships broken installs" argument
  still holds, so the ceiling stays.
- **Cumulative exact disjunction (dsh-TUI style, add-only).** The install
  surface is exact but inflates over time, and peers no longer reflect any
  support semantics (the TUI itself admits peers are wider than its
  validation list, backstopped by a drift warning). The bounded interval
  expresses the same "allow" with two bounds while keeping the two real
  constraints: the floor (build API lower bound) and the minor-line
  boundary.
- **Single caret pin (better-sidebar style `^0.2.0-rc.1`).** Under
  `includePrerelease` this is equivalent to "the whole current minor line
  admitted"; same expressiveness as the bounded interval, but one caret
  disjunct per minor line degrades into multiple caret disjuncts beyond
  two lines — less direct than a single interval.

## Consequences

Maintenance events drop from "one per host RC" to "one per minor line", and
freshly-out-of-window users like `rc.1` are no longer hard-rejected. The
cost: an ungated version inside the interval (e.g. a future `0.2.1-rc.1`)
installs by default and may break. Mitigations: the nightly tripwire finds
it within 24h, an emergency-tightening PR lands fast, README and
`docs/compatibility.md` state "outside the window, at your own risk"
explicitly, and (follow-up) the plugin emits a drift warning on out-of-window
hosts at startup.

This note supersedes the exact-disjunction decision in
[2026-09-29-exact-peer-disjunction.md](../archived/process/2026-09-29-exact-peer-disjunction.md);
that note's core argument — a peer declaration is an install-time-enforced
promise — still stands and is why this note keeps both bounds. The window
rule (including the transition clause) is implemented in
`docs/compatibility.md` and the `dsh-versions.txt` file header.
