# Agent Note: npm trusted publishing

Status: implemented

## Problem

The plugin had no npm distribution: `package.json` carried `private: true`,
and the unscoped name `dsh-subscription-hub` was already taken on npm by an
unknown third party. Meanwhile the npm ecosystem moved to tokenless
publishing — classic automation tokens were revoked in December 2025 and
mandatory 2FA arrived in 2026 — so any publish path built on long-lived CI
secrets would start out already obsolete. Distribution still matters: npm
gives the plugin a reserved name, a provenance anchor, and a `pnpm add`
install path that skips the GitHub `prepare` build, and DSH's plugin manager
already accepts registry specs (`dsh plugin add <name>` resolves through
pnpm). One bootstrap constraint shapes the whole flow: npm only lets a
trusted publisher be configured for a package that already exists, so the
first publish cannot be done by CI.

## Decision

The package was first published as `@goodboys-ai/dsh-subscription-hub`
(the `goodboys-ai` npm org is ours; the unscoped name was then squatted)
and is now `dsh-subscriptions` — the rename rationale and its alternatives
live in [2026-09-30-package-rename.md](2026-09-30-package-rename.md). The
trusted-publishing mechanics below are unchanged by the rename; only the
package name and the one-time bootstrap repeat. `private: true` is removed
and `"publishConfig": {"access": "public"}` added; the GitHub repo slug
`goodboys-ai/dsh-subscription-hub` was unchanged at rename time and became
`goodboys-ai/dsh-subscriptions` on 2026-10-01 (the old slug redirects
indefinitely). Publishing is OIDC trusted
publishing — the workflow mints an id-token, npm verifies it against the
trusted publisher configured on npmjs.com for repo
`goodboys-ai/dsh-subscriptions` + workflow `release.yml` + no environment
— so no token exists to leak or expire. The CI call is `npm publish
--provenance --access public` (the documented OIDC path), not `pnpm publish`.
A version containing `-` publishes under the `alpha` dist-tag so `latest`
keeps pointing at the newest stable release. The `npm-publish` job runs in
parallel with GitHub Release creation and skips a version npm already has,
which covers reruns and the manual bootstrap: for the scoped name the
maintainer published `0.1.0-rc.0` to `alpha` by hand, configured the
trusted publisher on npmjs.com, and CI took over from `v0.1.0` onward; the
rename repeats that bootstrap once for `dsh-subscriptions` (manual first
publish, trusted-publisher re-registration, then CI) — completed 2026-10-01
with the manual `dsh-subscriptions@0.1.0` publish (alpha and latest), the
trusted publisher registered against the new repo slug, and the scoped
package deprecated.

Install verification (2026-09-30, against the installed CLI and the npx
cache for every window version) found `dsh plugin add` DOES accept npm
registry specs: `@deepseek-ai/dsh-plugin-manager`'s `parseInstallSpec`
classifies a bare or scoped package name as `kind: "registry"` and the
install path runs `pnpm add <spec>` after a `pnpm view` registry check. So
the canonical install is `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-subscriptions`,
with the `github:` ref documented as the source alternative.

## Alternatives considered

- **Unscoped name `dsh-subscription-hub`.** Squatted by an unknown third
  party; recovering it is a dispute process with no guaranteed outcome.
  Scoping under our own org is immediate, unambiguous, and matches the repo
  owner.
- **Token-based CI publish.** Classic tokens are revoked (Dec 2025);
  granular tokens expire and are strictly weaker than OIDC — they prove
  possession of a secret, not which workflow run used it. Trusted publishing
  is the only path that carries provenance and needs no secret storage.
- **`pnpm publish`.** Works, but the OIDC exchange is documented against
  `npm publish`; fewer moving parts on the supported path outweigh package
  manager uniformity here.
- **Never publishing to npm.** The name stays exposed to future squatting,
  installs always run the GitHub `prepare` build (which DSH `0.1.7-rc.2`
  blocks by default), and releases carry no provenance anchor. The cost of
  publishing — one workflow job and one manual bootstrap — is small against
  those losses.

## Consequences

Users can install from npm (`dsh plugin --profile web add
dsh-subscriptions`) without triggering the `prepare` build that GitHub
installs need on DSH `0.1.7-rc.2`, and every CI publish carries npm
provenance. The maintainer owed one manual `0.1.0-rc.0` publish plus the
npmjs.com trusted-publisher configuration before the first tag (done for
the scoped name; the rename repeats both for `dsh-subscriptions`); a
mismatch there fails CI with E404/E403, which the workflow comment names.
The `alpha` dist-tag policy means prerelease users opt in explicitly while
`latest` stays stable. The `cordis.patch.yml` `insert.name` is a resolved
module specifier — dsh-app-boot resolves it through
`node_modules/<name>/package.json` — so it MUST equal the installed package
name (`dsh-subscriptions` after the rename); only display/log identities
(log prefixes, the Cordis `export const name`, browser module ID) follow
the same short name.
