# Agent Note: Package rename to dsh-subscriptions

Status: implemented

## Problem

The published package name `@goodboys-ai/dsh-subscription-hub` is awkward
everywhere a user types or reads it: the install command, the plugin
identity in logs and diagnostics, and UI copy. The obvious unscoped name
`dsh-subscription-hub` was squatted on npm by an unknown third party at
publication time and later unpublished — re-registration was unavailable
when we tried (npm reserves unpublished names per its policy as we
understand it; we verified only that the name could not be registered,
not the policy itself). Staying
on the scoped name is safe; it is also permanently clunky, and the
install-command friction compounds with every user.

## Decision

The npm package and the plugin identity are renamed to `dsh-subscriptions`:
`package.json` `name`, the Cordis `export const name`, the browser bundle
module ID, the `cordis.patch.yml` insert entry, log prefixes, and the
canonical install command (`dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-subscriptions`).
The GitHub repository slug `goodboys-ai/dsh-subscription-hub` is unchanged —
GitHub installs, the trusted-publisher repo binding, and all repo URLs keep
working. (Update 2026-10-01: the repository was subsequently renamed to
`goodboys-ai/dsh-subscriptions`; the old slug redirects indefinitely, and
the npm trusted publisher was registered against the new slug. The
bootstrap below was completed the same day: manual first publish of
`dsh-subscriptions@0.1.0`, trusted-publisher registration, and deprecation
of the scoped package.) The `v0.1.0` release stays published under the
scoped name as history; the rename repeats the npm bootstrap for the new
name (one manual publish, then trusted-publisher re-registration, per
[2026-09-30-npm-trusted-publishing.md](2026-09-30-npm-trusted-publishing.md)),
and the scoped package is deprecated with a pointer once the new name's
first publish succeeds. Installing both packages side by side registers the
same adapters twice and breaks plugin load, so the docs tell users to
remove the old package first.

## Alternatives considered

- **Keep the scoped name.** Zero migration risk, but the install and
  diagnostic friction is permanent, and every release cements the awkward
  name further. The rename cost is one bootstrap plus one deprecation —
  small while the package has ~zero users.
- **Attempt to recover the unscoped `dsh-subscription-hub`.** Observed
  unavailable after the squatter's unpublish; the reservation policy
  itself was not independently verified. Not an option, recorded so
  nobody re-investigates.
- **Rename the GitHub repo to match.** Breaks every existing clone, the
  trusted-publisher binding, and the `github:` install refs for no user
  benefit; the repo slug is not user-typed the way the package name is.

## Consequences

The maintainer owes a second manual bootstrap (first publish + trusted
publisher registration) for `dsh-subscriptions`, and the scoped package
must be deprecated after the new name's first publish. `v0.1.0` is orphaned
under the old name — acceptable with ~zero users, and the GitHub source
install path covers anyone who pinned it. The rename sweeps every identity
surface at once (the #19 F1 lesson: a partial rename that leaves
`cordis.patch.yml` `insert.name`, the bundle ID, or the boot-smoke grep
patterns pointing at the old name breaks plugin load in ways CI catches
only when the sweep is complete); `test/package-identity.spec.ts` pins the
chain so a future partial rename fails the gate.
