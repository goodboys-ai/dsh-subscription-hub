# Agent Note: Tag-driven release automation

Status: implemented

## Problem

Releases were fully manual: the maintainer pushed a `v*` tag by hand, then
wrote a GitHub Release from scratch — supported DSH versions, peer range,
install command, prerelease flag — copying the same compatibility facts out
of `docs/compatibility.md` every time. Hand-copied facts drift: a release
notes page stating the wrong window is user-facing misinformation that the
install gate cannot correct. There was also no enforcement that a tag equals
`package.json` `version` or that it points at a main commit, so a mistagged
or side-branch release was one command away.

## Decision

Pushing a `v*` tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which
auto-creates the GitHub Release directly (no draft). The `verify` job fails
unless the tag (minus `v`) exactly equals `package.json` `version` and the
tagged commit is an ancestor of `origin/main` — releases ride the PR flow.
The `gate-evidence` job requires a `success` `CI gate` check-run on the
tagged SHA via the check-runs API: CI runs on pushes to main, so the merge
commit a tag points at has its own check-runs, and trusting them avoids
re-running the per-version matrix. It also runs a light inline sanity on the
tag (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`,
`verify-agent-notes.mjs`, `check-compat-docs.mjs`) as a backstop. The
`release` job renders the fixed `## DSH compatibility` section with
`scripts/render-release-compat.mjs` (derived from `dsh-versions.txt` and the
shared peer range, failing on any peer disagreement), appends
`releases/generate-notes` output under it, and creates the release with
title = tag, adding `--prerelease` when the version contains `-`. A rerun
guard fails when the release already exists, since the `v*` tag ruleset
(id 24254540) makes tags immutable. Each release also adds one terse section
to `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Alternatives considered

- **Fully manual releases.** Zero machinery, but every release re-derives
  the compatibility statement by hand and nothing stops a tag that mismatches
  the package version or never passed CI. The workflow removes both failure
  modes at the cost of one YAML file.
- **Draft-first releases.** A draft lets a human review the rendered notes
  before publishing, but it adds a manual step to every release and the
  compat section is mechanical — there is nothing to review that the
  derivation did not already decide. Auto-created releases keep the tag push
  the single human action.
- **Re-running the full per-version matrix on every tag.** Proves the gate
  on the exact tagged tree inside the release run, but the tagged commit is
  the merge commit CI already gated on main, so it duplicates a matrix that
  takes far longer and can flake for unrelated reasons. The check-runs query
  plus the light inline sanity covers the same tree at a fraction of the
  cost.
- **Auto-generated notes only, without the compat section.** Zero
  maintenance, but the notes then say nothing about DSH compatibility — the
  fact users most need before installing — and nothing keeps them aligned
  with the window. The mechanical section costs one script and never drifts.
- **npm publishing in the same workflow.** Tempting to ship in one push, but
  it needs the scoped package rename and `publishConfig` decisions that this
  PR deliberately does not make. Deferred to a follow-up PR so this one
  ships reviewable machinery only.
- **Requiring signed tags.** Provenance would be stronger, but the `v*`
  ruleset already blocks tag deletion and non-fast-forward updates, and the
  repo has no signing infrastructure today. Deferred until supply-chain
  requirements demand it.

## Consequences

A release is now: merge the version PR, wait for CI on main, push the tag.
The compat statement in every release is derived, never copied, so it cannot
contradict `dsh-versions.txt`. The cost: `gate-evidence` trusts the
check-runs API, so a tag pushed before CI finishes on main fails with a
clear message and must be retried after — tags are immutable, so the retry
needs a new tag, which the version-mismatch guard already forces. If CI ever
stops running on main pushes, the check-runs query finds no gate and the
light inline sanity becomes the only evidence; the workflow comment and this
note name that dependency so the fallback is a deliberate edit, not a
surprise.
