# Agent Note: Upstream sync policy

Status: implemented

## Problem

This plugin is a downstream derivation of `V1ki/dsh-plugin-subscriptions`
and shares its provider protocol, auth store, and usage-accounting surface —
areas upstream keeps fixing. The fork also rewrote whole subsystems (the
settings UI, the RPC surface, network routing), so neither "merge upstream
wholesale" nor "ignore upstream" is viable. Without a recorded baseline and
a repeatable procedure, every sync attempt re-derives the fork point from
scratch and silently drifts: fixes land twice or not at all, and nobody can
say which upstream tag the shipped code corresponds to.

## Decision

Syncs run **git-native against upstream tags**. This repo's history contains
every upstream commit through `v0.9.5` (`75a8346`) as a literal ancestor —
the repo was derived from a full upstream clone — so `git fetch upstream
--tags` plus `git log <baseline>..<new-tag>` enumerates the exact delta, and
`git merge-base --is-ancestor` verifies any claim that a commit is already
shipped. Each commit in the delta is then either cherry-picked (files intact
on both sides) or re-implemented (files the fork rewrote; only the intent
ports). The baseline, the ported commits, and the deliberately skipped ones
are recorded in [docs/upstream-sync.md](../../docs/upstream-sync.md), which
is updated in the same PR as the port. The first port under this policy is
upstream `f6e1b3f` (Settings shows the CLI version Codex and Claude present,
with its source), fixing upstream issue #108.

The upstream README snapshots in `docs/` are refreshed only when the
baseline moves; their header comment names the tag they match.

## Alternatives considered

- **Wholesale upstream merges.** Impossible in the rewritten areas: the
  settings section, RPC surface, and proxy removal conflict without end,
  and resolving them re-introduces the retired plugin proxy. Merge-only
  also imports upstream's release chores, which this repo's CI owns.
- **Vendored-snapshot model (the cursor-transport pattern).** Copying
  upstream files into `vendor/` with an origin record works for the Cursor
  transport because that code has no shared history. The plugin-level
  upstream shares this repo's commit graph, so vendoring would discard the
  cherry-pick path and re-create the drift problem it solves.
- **Stop tracking upstream.** The provider protocols (Codex, Claude, Grok,
  Copilot, Antigravity) keep changing server-side; upstream is where the
  community lands the fixes first. Untracked drift shows up as user-visible
  bugs (a failed npm lookup reading as a plan limit, an empty credential
  poisoning the store) that upstream already fixed.
## Consequences

Each upstream release costs one classification pass over
`git log <baseline>..<new-tag>` — small while the delta stays small — plus
the port work itself. The sync record in `docs/upstream-sync.md` makes the
shipped baseline auditable at any time (`git merge-base --is-ancestor`
against the recorded SHA), and the snapshots' header comments tie the
README evidence to a tag. The cost: the policy depends on the shared
commit graph surviving repo surgery (a history rewrite would break the
`merge-base` checks and force a re-baseline); and re-implemented ports need
their own tests, since the upstream test may target UI this fork replaced.
