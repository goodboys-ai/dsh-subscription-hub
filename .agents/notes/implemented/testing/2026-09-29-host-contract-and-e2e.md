# Agent Note: Host contract manifest and host E2E

Status: implemented

## Problem

The plugin runs only inside a DSH host, and the client bundle reads host
modules at runtime. Several failures therefore pass `tsc`, the unit suite,
and the boot smoke, and show up only in a user's browser:

- DSH 0.1.7 renamed its 16px glyphs from `Icon<Name>16` to
  `Icon<Name>Regular`. The old name compiled against the pinned
  declarations, rendered `undefined`, and crashed the usage badge slot
  (upstream #116) and then the image and video tool views (`659151a`).
- The slot renderer catches an entry's crash and logs
  `slot entry crashed in '<slot>'`. The page keeps working and the feature
  is just gone, so nothing reaches the page's error handlers.
- A slot outlet, DOM marker, or theme token the host drops leaves no error at
  all. The video tool view's placeholder background used an undefined token
  (`--dsw-alias-fill-tertiary`) until the manifest check below flagged it.

Hand-made host fakes in unit tests cannot see any of this: they encode what
we believe the host provides, which is exactly the belief that went stale.

## Decision

**One manifest of runtime host assumptions.** `src/client/host-contract.ts`
lists the host names the client uses that the compiler cannot check:
icons, slots, context services, DOM markers, theme tokens, slot-crash
diagnostics, and the shell's static module table, each next to the host
package that owns it. The module has no imports, so plain Node scripts load
it directly.

- `scripts/check-host-contract.mjs --dsh <v>` checks that each entry appears
  in that version's published JavaScript, per CI matrix version and nightly
  against the newest DSH on npm. The check is textual; the E2E covers the
  runtime path of what it renders.
- `test/host-contract.spec.ts` scans `src/client` and fails both when code
  uses an unlisted host name and when a listed name is no longer used. The
  scan reads literals in any quote style and namespace-import members, and
  its self-tests pin those forms. A name computed at runtime, or a new way
  of reaching the host, escapes it; the E2E and code review are the backstop
  there.
- `hostIcon()` logs `HOST_CONTRACT_MISS` when a glyph is missing under both
  namings, so a miss is visible in the browser console.

**A host E2E that asserts the plugin-host contract, not host UI.**
`scripts/host-e2e.sh` boots `dsh web` with a fake signed-in profile and a
network preload, and `scripts/host-e2e.mjs` drives it through headless
Chrome over CDP. It asserts what the plugin promises the host and the user:
usage RPC values, the model in the picker, a streamed reply in the
transcript, the pill inside the host's stats row with each source's own
percentage in its dialog, no crashed slot, and no unplanned request from
the server or the page. Onboarding, workspace, and menu clicks are harness
steps; a failed harness step is retried once and reported as a harness
failure (exit 2). A failed assertion is never retried (exit 1), and an
attempt whose page crashed a slot, missed a contract name, threw, or left
loopback counts as a failed assertion even when a harness step also
failed, so a retry cannot hide it.

Specific choices inside the E2E:

- **Default workspace instead of the directory picker.** A `--patch` overlay
  sets `workspace-controller` `documentsDirectory` to the temp home, and the
  host opens its first-use workspace there on both supported versions. The
  picker is kept only as a fallback; its first listing resets a typed path
  when it lands late, which made the earlier driver flaky.
- **One fixture module.** `scripts/host-e2e-fixture.mjs` holds the reply
  text, the model, each source's percentage, and the planned refusals. The
  preload serves those values and the driver expects them, so neither side
  can drift alone. The driver never imports the preload, because the
  preload patches the network of whichever process loads it.
- **Refuse by default, match exactly.** The preload answers requests whose
  method and URL exactly match a planned fixture, and only with the exact
  fixture credential; it refuses every other non-loopback fetch and TCP
  connection, and logs both. Model catalog discovery is refused on purpose,
  which also checks that the picker falls back to the static model list
  offline. Any refusal not listed in the fixture module fails the run, and
  so does a required fixture nobody requested, so a new provider request
  needs a deliberate fixture or refusal.
- **Fence the browser too.** Chrome does not load the preload. It runs with
  a proxy on a dead local port and resolver rules that fail every hostname
  but localhost, and the driver fails the run on any non-loopback request
  in the CDP network events. The preload does not stop DNS lookups; neither
  guard sends a request, but a refused hostname may still be resolved.
- **Crash signals come from the host contract.** The driver reads the crash
  log line and error attribute from `HOST_CONTRACT.diagnostics`, and
  `check-host-contract.mjs` checks that the renderer still emits them. If a
  host changes how it reports a slot crash, the contract check fails rather
  than the E2E going blind.
- **Evidence.** The driver saves the RPC answers and, for each browser
  attempt, a screenshot, DOM, console log, page requests, and summary, on a
  pass too, since a later request-log check can still fail. On failure the
  shell adds the server, install, and provider request logs. CI uploads
  them as `host-e2e-evidence-<version>`.
- **Bounded waits.** Every RPC call and CDP command has a timeout, and a
  closed CDP socket fails every pending call, so a wedged host or browser
  ends the run instead of holding the CI job.

The boot smoke keeps only the logged-out checks and needs no browser.

The host-export and host contract checks, the boot smoke, and the host E2E
exit 1 only for a finding they explicitly recognise (a compiler diagnostic,
a missing contract name or host package, the host refusing the plugin's
peers, a failed assertion)
and exit 2 for everything else, including unexpected exceptions. The
nightly job opens an issue only for exit 1. The other default was tried
first and kept leaking: every uncaught setup error (an npm outage, an
unreadable file, a failed `mktemp`) exited 1 and would have opened a false
compatibility issue. With this default, a finding the scripts do not yet
recognise fails the job without an issue, which is noisy but never a false
report.

## Verification

Each assertion was seen to fail against a mutant of the packed plugin on
DSH 0.2.0-rc.1 (2026-09-29): the pill rendered outside the stats row, a
composer slot entry that throws on render, and a Codex translator that drops
text deltas. Each mutant failed as a product failure with a message naming
the broken promise, and the crash mutant's console line was reported. The
unmodified tarball passes on 0.1.7-rc.2 and 0.2.0-rc.1.

## Alternatives considered

**Extend the boot smoke with the browser checks.** The first version of this
work did that. It mixed a fast, browser-free install gate with a slow,
browser-driven one, so a picker timing problem failed the install gate and
the logged-out checks could not run without Chrome. Separate jobs keep the
cheap gate cheap and give the E2E its own evidence and retry policy.

**Playwright instead of raw CDP.** Upstream #116 checked its badge with a
Playwright script against a synthetic page. Playwright would add a large
dev dependency and its own browser download to a repo whose CI image
already has Chrome, and the driver needs only navigation, evaluation, key
input, console capture, and a screenshot, which are a few CDP calls.

**Assert host UI details (labels, layout) in the E2E.** Host UI changes every
release and is not ours to test. Asserting it would turn host redesigns into
red builds with nothing to fix in the plugin. The E2E uses host UI only to
reach states, and fails on it only as a harness failure.

**Keep host assumptions in each call site.** Before the manifest, the icon
naming, slot keys, and markers were scattered through `src/client`. Nothing
could check them against a published host, and nothing noticed an assumption
nobody used any more.

## Consequences

Drift in the listed runtime names is caught per DSH version before a user
sees it, and nightly against the newest DSH before it enters the window. A
slot crash anywhere on the E2E's path fails CI with the crashing slot named.

The cost: a CI job that needs Chrome and boots DSH per version, a manifest
every client change that reads a new host name must update, and a harness
that follows host UI changes (onboarding labels, the model menu). A harness
break shows as exit 2 with a screenshot, and is fixed in the driver, not the
plugin. The E2E covers one provider's generation path (Codex) and the usage
bar; other providers' generation stays with the integration tests and the canary.
