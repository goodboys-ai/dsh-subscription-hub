# Agent Note: Single-tarball CI

Status: implemented

## Problem

One plugin revision must work across the whole DSH support window. If each
matrix job rewrites dependencies and packs its own tarball, CI tests a
different package on each DSH version and cannot establish that one package
works across the window. The packed layout and cordis patch must also be
checked on a clean install rather than inferred from a source build.

## Decision

CI packs **exactly one tarball**, from the repository's pinned dependencies
(the window floor), in the `pack` job. The `boot-smoke` matrix downloads
that same tarball artifact and boots it on every DSH version in
`dsh-versions.txt`. The per-version `build-and-test` jobs only swap
`devDependencies` to run the build, the test suite, and the L1 host-export
check against each DSH line — they never pack. There is deliberately no
per-version artifact.

Why the tarball and not the checkout: a raw-directory install carries
`node_modules` and never exercises the packed layout. The tarball checks
`@deepseek-ai/*` resolving from the host (no `node_modules` shipped), the
`files` allowlist (`lib`, `vendor/cursor`, `cordis.patch.yml`), and the cordis
patch applying to a clean tree. `boot-smoke.sh` builds an isolated
`DSH_HOME` (a `mktemp` dir, never the user's real profiles), installs with
`dsh plugin add`, boots `dsh web --no-open --port 0`, and asserts the trust
handshake (single-use `?token=` URL → 303 + session cookie → app page 200),
that the served HTML references `subscription-hub/client.js`, that the
bundle responds with non-empty JavaScript, and that the log shows no cordis
patch skips or module-load failures.

The smoke test also exercises installer dependencies: it caught a missing
pnpm setup in CI because `dsh plugin add` invokes pnpm (`47e05213`).

## Alternatives considered

- **Per-version pack (the original flow).** Described above. Rejected on
  review: it verified N artifacts and shipped an (N+1)th.
- **Boot the raw checkout instead of the tarball.** Faster iteration, and
  fine for local development (`boot-smoke.sh` supports it), but it skips
  every packed-layout check that distinguishes a release from a checkout.
  The packed-layout check requires the tarball.
- **Smoke-test a single DSH version.** Cheaper, but the peer disjunction
  exists to span the window — installing on one version would leave the
  cross-version install claim (the whole point of the disjunction) to the
  solver's word. The matrix boots the identical bytes everywhere.

## Consequences

Every supported DSH version boots the same tarball bytes, and the peer
disjunction is exercised through a real plugin install. The `pack` job is
a dependency of each boot-smoke job; a packaging mistake fails the matrix.
The README's GitHub install runs `prepare` on the user's machine, so this
tarball check does not establish byte identity with that install path.
