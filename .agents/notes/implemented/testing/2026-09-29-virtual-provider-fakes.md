# Agent Note: Virtual-provider fakes

Status: implemented

## Problem

Provider login, refresh, usage, model discovery, and streaming logic need
repeatable regression tests. CI has no provider credentials and does not call
production provider servers; unit tests around adapter helpers alone do not
exercise the full plugin flow or its request shapes.

## Decision

Each of the six current provider routes has a fetch-level fake in
`test/fakes/` and an integration spec in `test/`. The spec drives the real
plugin flow against the fake: OAuth redirects, where applicable, reach a real
local callback server; token responses carry claims read by the real session
parser; and usage, catalog, and supported stream responses exercise the real
adapters.
The [testing strategy](../../../../docs/testing.md) owns the layer's
procedure and coverage list.

Localhost requests pass through to the callback server. Unknown provider
URLs return 404 rather than reaching production. Specs assert observed wire
details such as grant types, encoding, authorization headers, and request
bodies, including refresh and rejected-state behavior. This pins the
plugin's side of the protocol while keeping CI offline.

## Verification boundaries

The fakes import some endpoint constants from production adapters. This
keeps renamed constants aligned, but it cannot verify their URL values: a
wrong value in the shared constant makes both sides agree and the test stays
green. Independent literal URL expectations are needed to cover that gap.

Cursor generation uses ConnectRPC over `node:http2`, outside the fetch
router. Its login polling, refresh, dashboard usage, and protobuf model
discovery are tested; its model stream is not. Grok OIDC discovery is cached
per module load, so the spec checks the first discovery request without an
order-dependent standalone test.

No fake proves that a provider still honors the recorded protocol. The
manual pre-release canary remains responsible for provider-side drift.

## Alternatives considered

- **Adapter-level dependency mocks.** They would bypass the HTTP request
  shapes and callback path that this layer must cover. The fetch-level
  boundary observes those behaviors.
- **Recorded production responses.** Offline replay would avoid CI calls to
  providers, but recordings can contain sensitive material and become stale
  without failing when a provider changes. Explicit synthetic cases also
  make refresh and rejection behavior easier to exercise.
- **Real-provider calls in CI.** They would detect provider drift, but need
  consumer OAuth credentials in automation and contact production servers.
  The project keeps those checks in the manual canary.

## Consequences

The suite catches regressions in the plugin's request construction, claim
parsing, refresh handling, catalog filtering, and supported stream
translation without provider credentials. Endpoint URL correctness, Cursor's
HTTP/2 model stream, and provider-side changes remain outside this layer.
