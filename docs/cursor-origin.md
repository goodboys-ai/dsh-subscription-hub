# Cursor transport origin

`vendor/cursor/index.js` and `vendor/cursor/proto.js` were copied from
[orrinzeng/dsh-cursor-subscription](https://github.com/orrinzeng/dsh-cursor-subscription)
at commit `26f6cb1`. The original MIT license is retained at
`vendor/cursor/LICENSE`.

The host imports only `CursorAdapter`; the standalone plugin's own `apply`,
settings page, RPC, and credential controller are not mounted. This project
uses its own Cursor sign-in and usage UI and the DSH credential service.
`src/providers/cursor-adapter.ts` projects DSH `0.1.7-rc.2` first-class tool
messages into the transport's legacy tool-result blocks before streaming.

The transport uses Cursor's undocumented Agent protocol. Its protocol tests
are run offline against the copied files, but an authenticated Cursor model
request is still needed to confirm current server behavior.
