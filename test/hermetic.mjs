//
// Every outbound TCP connection goes through net.Socket#connect: fetch
// (undici), net.connect, node:http, node:https, node:tls, and node:http2 all
// end there. A connection to anything other than loopback throws EHERMETIC
// before DNS or a SYN, so a test that forgets to mock a provider fails at
// once instead of calling the real service with whatever credentials the
// machine has.
// Loopback stays open because the OAuth callback servers and the fake
// provider servers under test listen on it. Unix sockets stay open too.
//
// Production code often catches fetch failures (a version lookup falls back,
// a usage poll keeps its last value), so the throw alone can be swallowed and
// the test still passes. Each refusal is therefore also recorded, and the
// spec process exits non-zero, which fails that spec file in the runner.
//
// test/hermetic.spec.ts proves the guard is loaded in every run.
