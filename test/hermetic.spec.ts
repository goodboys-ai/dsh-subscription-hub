/**
 * The network guard in test/hermetic.mjs is loaded by the `test` script, not
 * by any spec. This file fails when a runner change drops the `--import`, so
 * the suite cannot quietly start reaching real provider hosts again.
 *
 * The guard fails any spec process that was refused a connection, even when
 * the error was caught. This spec is refused on purpose once per client
 * below and declares that count, so its own process still exits cleanly.
 *
 * The hosts are `.invalid` names, which never resolve, so a guard that stops
 * working fails here with a DNS error rather than reaching a real server.
